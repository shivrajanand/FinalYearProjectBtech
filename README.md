# Sanskrit–Hindi Translation App

## 🔤 Powered by Finetuned NLLB-200-Distilled-600M

This app translates Sanskrit sentences into Hindi using a fine-tuned NLLB-200-Distilled-600M model. The model was specifically trained on a domain-specific parallel corpus.

### 🚀 Performance Metrics
- **BLEU Score**: 11.33
- **ChrF++ Score**: 37.68

### 🧠 Key Features
- Translates Sanskrit input to Hindi using a transformer-based model.
- Trained for 60 epochs on a custom Sanskrit–Hindi parallel corpus.
- Substantial performance boost over zero-shot baselines.
- Handles morphologically rich and linguistically complex input.

### 💡 How to Use
1. Enter a Sanskrit sentence in the input box.
2. Or, select from the provided sample sentences for best results.

⚠️ Note: Translation may take a few seconds due to the model size.

⚠️ Note: It is highly possible that a random sentence might be wrongly translated since the model was trained on a relatively low size corupus which was very specific to it's field.

### 📚 Project Details
This is the final year B.Tech project (Batch 2021–25) from B. P. Mandal College of Engineering, Madhepura, under the guidance of **Prof. Sujeet Kumar**.

The app showcases the best model obtained after **226 hours** of training. It demonstrates the practical application of advanced machine learning techniques.

> This is a research-oriented project and may still have room for improvement and optimization.

### 📄 Project Abstract
The project “Finetuning NLLB-200-Distilled-600M for Sanskrit to Hindi Translation” addresses the challenges of translating between low-resource, grammatically complex languages. The model was fine-tuned on an in-house corpus and significantly outperformed baselines.

- **Zero-shot BLEU/ChrF++ scores**: 0–1 / <2
- **Post-finetuning scores**: BLEU 11.33 / ChrF++ 37.68

This project highlights the importance of task-specific training and quality datasets for improving translation quality in multilingual models.
